# YOLO Implementation in Keras (TensorFlow 2)
In this project, I attempt to implement and train YOLO (v1) as described in the paper [You Only Look Once](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) using TensorFlow 2's Keras API implementation. I also used some details in the [yolov1.cfg](yolov1.cfg) file provided by the author of the paper at github.com/pjreddie/darknet.
